Analyze project code and create a codebase guide so-called `app-codebase-guide.md`

SignalMeter displays on screen the LTE Network parameters such as RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power), RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality), and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). Implement a feature which displays the 5G Network parameters as well. On screen I should expect to have: SS-RSRP (Synchronization Signal Reference Signal Received Power), SS-RSRQ (Synchronization Signal Reference Signal Received Quality), and SS-SINR (Synchronization Signal Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio).

SignalMeter displays on screen the LTE Network parameters such as RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power), RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality), and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). Make SignalMeter display 3G network parameters such as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and RSCP (Received Signal Code Power).

SignalMeter displays on screen the LTE Network parameters such as RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power), RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality), and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). Make SignalMeter display 2G network parameters such as RSCP (Received Signal Code Power), SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) and EcNo (Energy per chip over the noise spectral density).

Make app display only current network parameters, that is, if current network is LTE, app must only display LTE signal parameters.

When the Android device is changing network type, the app is not updating screen to match with the registered network type. Make code improvement to overcome this problem.
